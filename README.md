# # JOB-CARD</br>
This a project on RPA implementation for JOB CARD generation.
The automation was done using data from a EXCEL SHEET, UiPATH tools and Zoho desktop.
It is based on Attended Automation.

#  Instructions</br>
After processing, try to rename the Request file as Request + Date Timestamp before moving it to the Requests folders. In real life, this should help in sorting queries in order of their time of modification especially in situations where similar queries have already been lodged. 
Try to capture all the fields (not just the mandatory three) to create the ticket in Zoho.
Enhance the "attended automation" type of RPA - that we just created and you just improved upon - to include the option to Stop Automation by using a hotkey.
